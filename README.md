# Auto Dict Unpack (MaxMSP/Jitter)
Ever lose your mind trying to unpack massive dictionaries in Max8? 

Try this useful little js helper tool to automagically script the arguments required to parse dictionaries in MaxMSP / Jitter
Also checks for types (Float, Int,Symbols) and spawns the appropriate UI objects and comment annotations in the parent and subpatcher

1. Save this script as `autodictunpack.js` in your [Search Paths](https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/vignettes/search_path)
2. Instantiate `[js autodictunpack.js]` in any patch you're working on
